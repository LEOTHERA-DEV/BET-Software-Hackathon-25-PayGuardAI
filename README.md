# BET-Software-Hackathon-25-PayGuardAI

A payment solution that works both online and offline and integrates AI-powered fraud detection
to protect users from suspicious transactions before they even happen.
When offline, the app queues transactions locally and still runs on-device AI models to detect
potentially fraudulent patterns (like unusual payment amounts, locations, or merchant behavior).
Once the device reconnects, it syncs with the server and pushes any alerts or blocked
transactions for final verification.
